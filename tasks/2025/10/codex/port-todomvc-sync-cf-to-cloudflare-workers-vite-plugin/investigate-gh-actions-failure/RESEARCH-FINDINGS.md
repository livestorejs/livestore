# Research Findings on Error 7003 in GitHub Actions

## Research Conducted

I performed extensive searches to find evidence for the hypothesis that GitHub Actions IPs are blocked by Cloudflare Workers API:

1. ✅ General Cloudflare blocking GitHub Actions IPs
2. ✅ Error 7003 in GitHub Actions contexts
3. ✅ Wrangler deployment failures in CI/CD
4. ✅ Authentication issues with Cloudflare Workers API
5. ✅ Community forum discussions about error 7003

## What I Found

### 1. General Evidence of Cloudflare Blocking GitHub Actions

- **Multiple workarounds exist**: GitHub marketplace has actions specifically to bypass Cloudflare when using GitHub Actions
- **Stack Overflow questions**: Multiple questions about setting up Cloudflare to allow GitHub Actions to complete
- **Known pattern**: Cloudflare can block GitHub Actions IPs through WAF rules, but this is typically for web scraping prevention, not API access

### 2. Error 7003 Documentation

From official Cloudflare troubleshooting docs:

> `Could not route to /client/v4/accounts/<Account ID>/workers/services/<Worker name>, perhaps your object identifier is invalid? [code: 7003]`

**Common causes documented**:
- Incorrect `account_id` in wrangler.toml
- Invalid worker names (e.g., "accounts" causes routing conflicts)
- Insufficient API token permissions
- Stale/expired tokens

**Recommended solutions**:
- Remove or update `account_id` in wrangler.toml
- Verify token permissions
- Create new API token if current one is stale

### 3. CI/CD Authentication Differences

**Critical finding from official docs**:

> "When running Wrangler locally, authentication to the Cloudflare API happens via the wrangler login command, which initiates an interactive authentication flow. Since CI/CD environments are non-interactive, Wrangler requires a Cloudflare API token and account ID to authenticate with the Cloudflare API."

This explains why local and CI behave differently - but we ARE passing the API token and account ID correctly.

### 4. GitHub Issues Analysis

**Issue #2100**: User reported "GitHub deploy actions are erroring with similar errors" - the solution was removing `account_id` from wrangler.toml

**Issue #314**: Authentication error in wrangler-action was fixed by explicitly passing `accountId` parameter

**Issue #1177**: Error 7003 for Pages upload-token - cause was insufficient token permissions

## What I Did NOT Find

❌ **No specific evidence that Cloudflare Workers API blocks GitHub Actions IPs**
- No GitHub issues in cloudflare/workers-sdk mentioning IP blocking
- No community forum posts confirming this behavior
- No official documentation about IP restrictions on Workers API

❌ **No documented cases matching our exact symptoms**:
- Token works perfectly in Docker (isolated environment)
- `wrangler whoami` succeeds in GitHub Actions
- But ALL Workers API calls fail in GitHub Actions
- Same token, same account, same code

## The Contradiction

Our testing definitively proves:

| Test | Result | Conclusion |
|------|--------|------------|
| Docker test with CI token | ✅ All APIs work | Token has correct permissions |
| Act-CLI test with CI token | ✅ All APIs work | Token not IP-restricted |
| GitHub Actions with CI token | ✅ `whoami` works<br>❌ Workers API fails | Basic auth works, Workers API blocked |

**The contradiction**:
- All documented causes of error 7003 are ruled out by our Docker testing
- Token permissions are correct (proven by Docker)
- Account ID is correct (proven by Docker)
- Worker names are valid (not reserved)
- Token is not IP-restricted (works from any network locally)

Yet the error ONLY occurs in GitHub Actions.

## Hypotheses Remaining

### Hypothesis 1: Undocumented GitHub Actions Restrictions

Cloudflare may have undocumented security measures that:
- Block or rate-limit GitHub Actions runner IPs
- Apply specifically to Workers API endpoints (not basic auth)
- Are not publicly documented for security reasons

**Evidence for**: Our testing pattern matches this exactly
**Evidence against**: No documentation or public acknowledgment

### Hypothesis 2: GitHub Actions Environment Quirk

Something about the GitHub Actions environment causes Wrangler or the Cloudflare API client to malfunction:
- Different network routing
- DNS resolution issues
- TLS/certificate problems
- Request header differences

**Evidence for**: Error only occurs in GitHub Actions
**Evidence against**: Direct curl tests also failed in CI (rules out Wrangler-specific issue)

### Hypothesis 3: Intermittent Cloudflare API Issue

The API might have been experiencing issues during our tests:
- API endpoint instability
- Regional routing problems
- Temporary rate limiting

**Evidence for**: Error 7003 is sometimes described as a transient error
**Evidence against**: Consistently reproducible over multiple CI runs

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Contact Cloudflare Support (Recommended)

Given the evidence collected, this appears to be a Cloudflare-side issue. Contact support with:

1. **Evidence package**:
   - Diagnostic script output from GitHub Actions
   - Proof that same token works in Docker
   - GitHub Actions run URLs showing failures
   - Account ID and token ID (not the token itself)

2. **Specific question**: "Why does our API token work for `/user/tokens/verify` but fail for `/accounts/.../workers/services` endpoints when called from GitHub Actions infrastructure, while working perfectly from Docker and local environments?"

### Option 2: Implement Workaround

Use a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner:
- Deploy on your own infrastructure (not GitHub's)
- Should work since Docker from your machine works
- Requires maintaining runner infrastructure
- Quick fix while investigating root cause

### Option 3: Alternative CI Provider

Temporarily use a different CI provider:
- GitLab CI
- CircleCI
- Any provider whose IPs aren't affected
- Test if problem persists

### Option 4: Continue Investigation

Possible investigation paths:
1. **Test from different cloud providers**: Try deploying from AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, etc. to see if it's specific to GitHub Actions or all CI/CD infrastructure
2. **Network analysis**: Capture full HTTP request/response headers in GitHub Actions vs Docker to spot differences
3. **Timing analysis**: Test if the issue is intermittent or time-based (rate limiting)

## Summary

Despite extensive research, I found **no definitive evidence that GitHub Actions IPs are blocked by Cloudflare Workers API**, though this remains the most plausible explanation given our test results. The gap between what we observe (token works everywhere except GitHub Actions) and what's documented suggests this may be an undocumented security measure or an unacknowledged issue.

**The strongest evidence is empirical, not documentary**: Our isolated Docker tests prove the token and configuration are correct, yet GitHub Actions consistently fails. This pattern suggests environmental/infrastructure differences rather than configuration issues.
