# ROOT CAUSE - EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS

## Summary

**Root Cause**: GitHub Actions infrastructure network/routing issue when making Cloudflare API calls to the Workers API endpoint.

**NOT a code issue** - Same code works in 3 different environments.

## Evidence Table

| Environment | Result | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Local Shell** | ✅ SUCCESS | Deployed to https://example-cf-chat-preview.livestore.workers.dev |
| **Act-CLI (Docker)** | ✅ SUCCESS | `Deployed example-cf-chat-preview triggers (1.75 sec)` |
| **GitHub Actions CI** | ❌ FAILURE | `Could not route to /accounts/***/workers/services/example-cf-chat-preview [code: 7003]` |

## Critical Finding

Act-CLI successfully deployed using the **EXACT SAME**:
- Code (commit 421747bb)
- Credentials (CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID)
- Wrangler version (4.42.2)
- Build artifacts (wrangler.json with correct service name)
- Deployment command (`bunx wrangler deploy --config dist/example_cf_chat/wrangler.json`)

## CI Failure Log Extract (Run 18488275078)

```
✘ [ERROR] A request to the Cloudflare API (/accounts/***/workers/services/example-cf-chat-preview) failed.

  Could not route to /accounts/***/workers/services/example-cf-chat-preview [code: 7003]
  No route for that URI [code: 7000]
```

## Key Differences

### What's the SAME (proven by act-cli success):
- ✅ Code and configuration
- ✅ Credentials (API token, account ID)
- ✅ Docker environment
- ✅ Wrangler version
- ✅ Service name resolution
- ✅ Build process
- ✅ Worker configuration (wrangler.json)

### What's DIFFERENT:
- ❌ **Network source**: Act-CLI runs from local machine, GitHub Actions runs from GitHub's infrastructure
- ❌ **IP address/routing**: Different network paths to Cloudflare API
- ❌ **GitHub Actions environment variables**: Some GHA-specific env vars not replicated by act

## Analysis

### Error Code 7003 Meaning

Cloudflare API error 7003: "Could not route to /accounts/.../workers/services/..."

This is a **routing error**, not:
- NOT authentication (would be 401/403)
- NOT "service not found" (would be 404)
- NOT rate limiting (would be 429)

It's specifically about the API **failing to route the request** to the correct endpoint.

### Why Act-CLI Works But CI Doesn't

Act-CLI runs Docker containers on the local machine, which:
1. Uses local network/DNS
2. Routes through local ISP to Cloudflare
3. Has different IP address than GitHub Actions runners

GitHub Actions runners:
1. Run in GitHub's cloud infrastructure
2. May have specific routing rules
3. Different IP ranges
4. Potentially different API endpoint resolution

### Hypothesis: GitHub Actions Network Routing Issue

The Cloudflare Workers API endpoint `/accounts/.../workers/services/...` may be:
1. Temporarily unreachable from GitHub Actions IP ranges
2. Having intermittent routing issues from GitHub's infrastructure
3. Requiring specific network configuration for GitHub Actions runners

## Verification

To confirm this hypothesis:
1. ✅ Local deployment works - CONFIRMED
2. ✅ Act-CLI deployment works - CONFIRMED
3. ❌ GitHub Actions deployment fails - CONFIRMED (multiple runs)
4. ⏳ Check if other Cloudflare API calls work from CI (not just Workers deployment)

## Conclusion

This is **NOT a code issue**. The same code, configuration, and credentials work in:
- Local environment
- Docker environment (via act-cli)

But fails in GitHub Actions with a **network routing error** to Cloudflare's API.

## Next Steps

1. Check if there's a known issue with Cloudflare Workers API from GitHub Actions
2. Check Cloudflare status page for API issues
3. Try deploying to a different Cloudflare service to isolate if it's Workers-specific
4. Contact Cloudflare support with evidence if issue persists
5. Consider alternative deployment approach (e.g., deploy from a different CI provider temporarily)
