# Final Investigation Summary - Cloudflare Example Deployment Failures

## Problem Statement

GitHub Actions CI was failing during Cloudflare Workers example deployment with two distinct issues:
1. esbuild EPIPE errors during CSS post-processing
2. Cloudflare API error 7003 - "Could not route to /accounts/***/workers/services/example-cf-chat-preview"

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: esbuild EPIPE Errors ‚úÖ SOLVED

**Error**: `[vite:css-post] The service was stopped: write EPIPE` after transforming 1122 modules

**Root Cause**: Building 3 examples concurrently exhausted CI resources, causing esbuild service crashes

**Fix**: Reduced concurrency from 3 to 1 in `scripts/src/examples/deploy-examples.ts:192`

**Result**: ‚úÖ Completely eliminated esbuild crashes

### Phase 2: Cloudflare API Error 7003 üîÑ IN PROGRESS

**Error**:
```
‚úò [ERROR] A request to the Cloudflare API (/accounts/***/workers/services/example-cf-chat-preview) failed.
  Could not route to /accounts/***/workers/services/example-cf-chat-preview [code: 7003]
  No route for that URI [code: 7000]
```

**Key Observations**:
1. ‚úÖ Same code works locally - successfully deployed to https://example-cf-chat-preview.livestore.workers.dev
2. ‚úÖ Service exists with multiple deployments (created Oct 13, 2025)
3. ‚úÖ Same API credentials work locally (can list deployments via wrangler)
4. ‚úÖ Same wrangler version (4.42.2)
5. ‚ùå CI consistently fails with routing error

**Failed Fix Attempts**:
1. ‚ùå Remove redundant `--name` parameter from wrangler deploy - No effect
2. ‚ùå Add dist cleanup (`rm -rf dist`) before builds - No effect

**Current Hypothesis**: Wrangler cache/state issue in CI environment

## Current Fix Being Tested

**Commit**: f1284f9f
**CI Run**: 18488643768
**Change**: Added wrangler cache clearing step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
- name: Clear wrangler cache
  run: rm -rf ~/.config/.wrangler ~/.wrangler
```

**Rationale**:
- Wrangler writes logs to `/home/runner/.config/.wrangler/logs/`
- May have stale state/cache causing API routing issues
- Local environment doesn't have this stale state
- Clearing cache forces fresh wrangler state for each CI run

## Files Modified

### 1. `scripts/src/examples/deploy-examples.ts` (Line 192)
```typescript
const results = yield* Effect.forEach(
  filteredExamples,
  (example) => deployExample({ ... }),
  { concurrency: 1 }, // Changed from 3
)
```

### 2. `scripts/src/shared/cloudflare.ts` (Lines 189-191)
```typescript
yield* cmd(['rm', '-rf', 'dist'], {
  cwd: example.repoRelativePath,
}).pipe(Effect.ignore)
```

### 3. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (Line 259-260)
```yaml
- name: Clear wrangler cache
  run: rm -rf ~/.config/.wrangler ~/.wrangler
```

## Verification Steps

Once CI completes:
1. ‚úÖ Check if examples deployment succeeds
2. ‚úÖ Verify all examples are deployed to Cloudflare
3. ‚úÖ Confirm no esbuild or Cloudflare API errors

If cache clearing works:
- Root cause confirmed: Wrangler state/cache issue
- Solution: Cache clearing step before deployment

If cache clearing doesn't work:
- Need deeper investigation into Cloudflare API permissions
- May need to check GitHub Actions secret configuration
- Consider running act-cli with full debugging enabled

## Technical Details

**Cloudflare API Error 7003**:
- Error code specifically indicates routing failure
- Not the same as "service not found" or "unauthorized"
- Suggests API endpoint resolution issue, not permissions

**Wrangler Behavior**:
- Wrangler stores state in `~/.config/.wrangler/` and `~/.wrangler/`
- May cache service lookups or API routes
- Cache might persist across CI runs via GitHub Actions caching

**Local vs CI Differences**:
- Local: Fresh wrangler state, no cached API routes
- CI: Potentially stale cache from previous runs
- CI: Different network environment, possibly affecting API routing

## Next Steps

1. ‚è≥ Wait for CI run 18488643768 to complete
2. üìä Analyze results
3. ‚úÖ If successful: Document solution and close investigation
4. ‚ùå If failed: Investigate act-cli reproduction or Cloudflare API issues
