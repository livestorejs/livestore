# CI Deployment Error Analysis

## Current Status

**CI Run**: 18488275078 (commit 421747bb - dist cleanup changes)
**Result**: ❌ FAILED with same Cloudflare API error 7003

## Error Details

```
✘ [ERROR] A request to the Cloudflare API (/accounts/***/workers/services/example-cf-chat-preview) failed.

  Could not route to /accounts/***/workers/services/example-cf-chat-preview, perhaps your object identifier is invalid? [code: 7003]
  No route for that URI [code: 7000]
```

## Timeline of Fixes

### Fix 1: Reduce Concurrency (✅ Solved esbuild EPIPE)
- **Change**: `concurrency: 3` → `concurrency: 1` in deploy-examples.ts:192
- **Result**: ✅ Completely eliminated esbuild EPIPE crashes
- **Status**: No more build crashes, but deployment still fails

### Fix 2: Remove `--name` Parameter (❌ No effect)
- **Change**: Removed redundant `--name` from wrangler deploy command
- **Rationale**: wrangler.json already contains the worker name from Vite plugin
- **Result**: ❌ Still same API error 7003

### Fix 3: Add Dist Cleanup (❌ No effect)
- **Change**: Added `rm -rf dist` before `pnpm build` in buildCloudflareWorker
- **Rationale**: Ensure clean builds without stale artifacts
- **Result**: ❌ Still same API error 7003
- **CI Run**: 18488275078

## Key Observations

### What Works ✅
1. ✅ Local build succeeds
2. ✅ Local deployment succeeds (created service at https://example-cf-chat-preview.livestore.workers.dev)
3. ✅ Same code, same credentials, same build artifacts
4. ✅ No more esbuild crashes

### What Fails ❌
1. ❌ CI deployment fails consistently
2. ❌ Error is about routing to non-existent service
3. ❌ But service exists now (created by local deployment)

## Hypothesis

The error suggests wrangler is trying to **look up** the service before deploying, and failing because it doesn't exist yet. But:

1. In local deployment, the service was created successfully
2. The error message is about "routing to" the service, not "creating" it
3. This suggests wrangler might be in the wrong mode (update vs create)

## Questions to Answer via act-cli

1. Does act-cli reproduce the same error?
2. If yes, what's different between local shell and Docker environment?
3. Is there wrangler state/cache that affects behavior?
4. What does wrangler.json actually contain in the built dist?

## Next Steps

1. ✅ act-cli is currently running (installing dependencies)
2. ⏳ Wait for act-cli to reach deployment phase
3. 🔍 Compare act-cli error (if any) with CI error
4. 🔍 Inspect wrangler.json contents
5. 🔍 Check wrangler logs for additional clues
