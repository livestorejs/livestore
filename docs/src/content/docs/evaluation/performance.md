We are continuously monitoring the performance of LiveStore to ensure that it meets our performance standards. We have a set of performance tests that are run on every commit to the `main` branch and on every pull request. For more details, check out the [performance tests](https://github.com/livestorejs/livestore/blob/main/tests/perf/README.md) in the GitHub repository
