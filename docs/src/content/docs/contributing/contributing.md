## Before contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to LiveStore! Building LiveStore has been an incredible amount of work, so everyone interested in contributing is very much appreciated. ðŸ§¡

Please note that LiveStore is still in active development with many things yet subject to change (e.g. APIs, examples, docs, etc).

Before you start contributing, please check with the maintainers if the changes you'd like to make are likely to be accepted. Please get in touch via the `#contrib` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RbMcjUAPd7).
