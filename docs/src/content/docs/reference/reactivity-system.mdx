LiveStore has a high-performance, fine-grained reactivity system built in which is similar to Signals (e.g. in [SolidJS](https://docs.solidjs.com/concepts/signals)).

## Defining reactive state

LiveStore provides 3 types of reactive state:
- Reactive SQL queries on top of SQLite state (`queryDb()`)
- Reactive state values (`signal()`)
- Reactive computed values (`computed()`)

Reactive state variables end on a `$` by convention (e.g. `todos$`). The `label` option is optional but can be used to identify the reactive state variable in the devtools.

### Reactive SQL queries

<QueryDbSnippet />

### Signals

Signals are reactive state values that can be set and get. This can be useful for state that is not materialized from events into SQLite tables.

### Computed values

<ComputedSnippet />

## Accessing reactive state

Reactive state is always bound to a `Store` instance. You can access the current value of reactive state the following ways:

### Using the `Store` instance

<StoreAccessSnippet />

### Via framework integrations

#### React

<ReactComponentSnippet />

#### Solid

<SolidComponentSnippet />

### Reacting to changing variables passed to queries

If your query depends on a variable passed in by the component, use the deps array to react to changes in this variable.
