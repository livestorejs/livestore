## Event definitions

There are two types of events:

- `synced`: Events that are synced across clients
- `clientOnly`: Events that are only processed locally on the client (but still synced across client sessions e.g. across browser tabs/windows)

An event definition consists of a unique name of the event and a schema for the event arguments. It's recommended to version event definitions to make it easier to evolve them over time.

Events will be synced across clients and materialized into state (i.e. SQLite tables) via [materializers](/reference/state/materializers).

### Best Practices

- It's strongly recommended to use past-tense event names (e.g. `todoCreated`/`createdTodo` instead of `todoCreate`/`createTodo`) to indicate something already occurred.
- When generating IDs for events (e.g. for the todo in the example above), it's recommended to use a globally unique ID generator (e.g. UUID, nanoid, etc.) to avoid conflicts. For convenience, `@livestore/livestore` re-exports the `nanoid` function.
- TODO: write down more best practices
- TODO: mention AI linting (either manually or via a CI step)
  - core idea: feed list of best practices to AI and check if events adhere to them + get suggestions if not
- It's recommended to avoid `DELETE` events and instead use soft-deletes (e.g. add a `deleted` date/boolean column with a default value of `null`). This helps avoid some common concurrency issues.

### Schema evolution \{#schema-evolution\}

- Event definitions can't be removed after they were added to your app.
- Event schema definitions can be evolved as long as the changes are forward-compatible.
  - That means data encoded with the old schema can be decoded with the new schema.
  - In practice, this means ...
    - for structs ...
      - you can add new fields if they have default values or are optional
      - you can remove fields

## Commiting events

## Eventlog

The history of all events that have been committed is stored forms the "eventlog". It is persisted in the client as well as in the sync backend.

Example `eventlog.db`:
