While LiveStore is framework agnostic, the `@livestore/react` package provides a first-class integration with React.

## Features

- High performance
- Fine-grained reactivity (using LiveStore's signals-based reactivity system)
- Instant, synchronous query results (without the need for `useEffect` and `isLoading` checks)
- Transactional state transitions (via `batchUpdates`)
- Also supports Expo / React Native via `@livestore/adapter-expo`

## API

### `LiveStoreProvider`

In order to use LiveStore with React, you need to wrap your application in a `LiveStoreProvider`.

<ReactProviderSnippet />

For scenarios where you have an existing store instance, you can manually create a `LiveStoreContext.Provider`:

<ReactContextSnippet />

### useStore

<ReactUseStoreSnippet />

### useQuery

<ReactUseQuerySnippet />

### useClientDocument

<ReactUseClientDocumentSnippet />

## Usage with ...

### Vite

LiveStore works with Vite out of the box.

### Tanstack Start

LiveStore works with Tanstack Start out of the box.

### Expo / React Native

LiveStore has a first-class integration with Expo / React Native via `@livestore/adapter-expo`.

### Next.js

Given various Next.js limitations, LiveStore doesn't yet work with Next.js out of the box.

## Technical notes

- `@livestore/react` uses `React.useState` under the hood for `useQuery` / `useClientDocument` to bind LiveStore's reactivity to React's reactivity. Some libraries are using `React.useExternalSyncStore` for similar purposes but using `React.useState` in this case is more efficient and all that's needed for LiveStore.
- `@livestore/react` supports React Strict Mode.
