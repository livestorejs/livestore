Works with Node.js, Bun and Deno.

## Example

<NodeAdapterSnippet />

## Resetting local persistence

During development you can instruct the adapter to wipe the locally persisted state and eventlog databases on startup:

<NodeResetPersistenceSnippet />

:::caution
This will delete all local data for the given `storeId` and `clientId`. It only clears local persistence and does not reset any connected sync backend. Only enable it for debugging scenarios.
:::

### Worker adapter

The worker adapter can be used for more advanced scenarios where it's preferable to reduce the load of the main thread and run persistence/syncing in a worker thread.
