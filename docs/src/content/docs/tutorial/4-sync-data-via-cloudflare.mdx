In this step, you are going to introduce a [sync](/reference/syncing/) backend. This sync backend will:

- have a "live connection" (via WebSockets) to _all_ the clients that are running your app
- propagate events to _all_ other clients whenever a particular client emits an event

Notice how you'll achieve this by only changing the data layer of your application! You won't need to touch the actual application code you've already implemented in `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`, all the syncing is handled by LiveStore under the hood without you needing to worry about it in your application code.

You are going to implement the sync backend using [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/), using the [@livestore/sync-cf](/reference/syncing/sync-provider/cloudflare/) package.
