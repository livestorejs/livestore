In this tutorial, you're going to use Cloudflare for deployment. 

:::note[Skip if you don't care about deployment]
If you're only interested in learning about concepts of LiveStore and don't care about deployment, you can skip this step and move to the next chapter.

**That being said, we recommend that you deploy the app so that you can experience first-hand the power of _syncing data across devices_ later in the tutorial.**

## Configure the Vite plugin for Cloudflare

First, you're going to install [Cloudflare's Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/):

```bash
pnpm add -D @cloudflare/vite-plugin
```

Now, add it to your `vite.config.ts`:

```diff title="vite.config.ts" lang="ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
+import { cloudflare } from '@cloudflare/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tailwindcss(),
+    cloudflare(),
  ],
})
```

## Configure Wrangler

Cloudflare deployments can be managed via [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), so you'll first need to install the Wrangler CLI:

```bash
pnpm add wrangler -D
```

Now, create a `wrangler.toml`:

```bash
touch wrangler.toml
```

Add the following contents to it:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "livestore-todo-app"
compatibility_date = "2024-10-28"

[observability]
enabled = true
```

## Configure `deploy` script

In your `package.json`, add a new script called `deploy` that looks as follows:

```diff title="package.json" lang="js"
// ... other properties
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "preview": "vite preview",
+  "deploy": "pnpm run build && wrangler deploy"
},
// ... other properties

```

## Deploy the app

Deploy the app by running the `deploy` script:

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

If everything worked as epected, your app is now running at: `https://livestore-todo-app.USERNAME.workers.dev`

Find your specific URL in the terminal output or navigate to the **Workers & Pages** section in your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) to find the project and the URL.

The app should look and behave exactly like the local version from the previous step:
