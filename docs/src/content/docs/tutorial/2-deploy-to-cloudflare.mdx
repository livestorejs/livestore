## Configure Wrangler

In this tutorial, you're going to use Cloudflare for deployment. 

:::note[Skip if you don't care about deployment]
If you're only interested in learning about concepts of LiveStore and don't care about deployment, you can skip this step and move to the next chapter.

**That being said, we recommend that you deploy the app so that you can experience first-hand the power of _syncing data across devices_ later in the tutorial.**
:::

Cloudflare deployments can be managed via [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), so you'll first need to install the Wrangler CLI:

```bash
pnpm add wrangler -D
```

Now, create a `wrangler.toml` with the following contents:

```bash
touch wrangler.toml
```
