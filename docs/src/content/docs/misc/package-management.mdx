title: Note on Package Management

export const catalog = `\
catalog:
  effect: ${EFFECT_VERSION} # As LiveStore depends on \`effect\`
	# also \`react\`, \`react-dom\` etc based on your project
`

import { EFFECT_VERSION } from '@local/shared'
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Recommended

It's strongly recommended to use `pnpm` or `bun` when building an app with LiveStore to avoid dependency issues (e.g. wrong version resolution, duplicate dependencies, etc).

### Peer dependencies

Since LiveStore has a few peer dependencies, you either should manually add them to your project or add the `@livestore/peer-deps` package to your project to satisfy them.

### PNPM Catalog

When using `pnpm`, we recommend specifying the following packages in your [PNPM Catalog](https://pnpm.io/catalogs):

<Code code={catalog} lang="yaml" title="pnpm-workspace.yaml" />
