## RFX: Request for exploration \{#rfx\}

LiveStore opens the door to many new possibilities. Many more than I could explore or build myself, so I invite you to explore some of the ideas below.

### Technological ideas

- Auth
  - Authn
  - Authz
  - e2ee
- Server side
  - React server rendering
  - Centralized read models
- Integrating with existing databases / systems
- CRDTs for text editing
  - Automerge / YJS as embedded data
- Collaboration
  - Presence features
  - Blob files
- Version control
  - Manual push/pull + git-like commits of multiple events
- Event-sourcing
  - Schema evolution: migrating events (e.g. cambria)
- Cross-app data interop
- AI
  - Local RAG
  - Agents

### Application ideas

It would be great to see a new generation of apps built with LiveStore - ideally each app being:

- [Local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/)
- Open-source
- Self-hostable

Here are some app ideas:

- Replacement for Doodle
- Replacement for Canny (feature requests)
- Replacement for Splitwise
- Replacement for Wunderlist
- GitHub client
- A secret Santa app
- Movie / TV tracking app
- Fitness app

### LiveStore internals

- Explore and improve multi-store ergonomics
- Diff queries in SQLite
- IVM
