# Example Applications

Discover how to build local-first applications with LiveStore through our comprehensive collection of example apps. Each example demonstrates different features, patterns, and platform integrations to help you get started quickly.

## Browse by Platform Adapter

LiveStore supports multiple platform adapters, each optimized for different environments. Choose the adapter that matches your target platform:

  <LinkCard 
    title="Web Adapter" 
    href="/examples/web-adapter/"
    description={`Browser-based applications with SQLite WASM, Web Workers, and framework integrations. ${webExamples.length} examples • React, SolidJS, Web Components`}
  />

  <LinkCard 
    title="Node Adapter" 
    href="/examples/node-adapter/"
    description={`Server-side applications, CLI tools, and backend services with native SQLite performance. ${nodeExamples.length} examples • Effect, CLI applications`}
  />

  <LinkCard 
    title="Expo Adapter" 
    href="/examples/expo-adapter/"
    description={`React Native mobile applications with offline-first architecture and cross-platform sync. ${expoExamples.length} examples • iOS, Android, React Native`}
  />

  <LinkCard 
    title="Cloudflare Durable Objects" 
    href="/examples/cloudflare-adapter/"
    description={`Edge computing with Durable Objects, global distribution, and serverless scaling. ${cloudflareExamples.length} examples • Workers, Durable Objects, Edge`}
  />
</CardGrid>

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your platform** from the adapter categories above
2. **Browse examples** that match your use case and framework preference  
3. **Clone and run** the examples locally to see LiveStore in action
4. **Study the source code** to understand patterns and best practices

## Multi-Adapter Examples

Some examples demonstrate **cross-platform synchronization** by using multiple adapters:
- **CF Chat** uses both Web and Cloudflare adapters for hybrid client-server architecture
- **Sync-enabled examples** show how to connect different platforms seamlessly

## About LiveStore
