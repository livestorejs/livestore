## TODO

- [x] Get rid of polling and use SSE instead
- [x] get rid of `any` types and use proper schemas
- [ ] simplify implementation of `sync-provider.ts` (lots of complexity)
- [x] get rid of `index.ts` file -> move to `sync-provider.ts`, add `mod.ts` for exports
- [x] factor more from API proxy to the library
 
- [x] Move more of library logic from API proxy to the library (e.g. event decoding)
- [x] Use the generated HTTP client
- [x] study S2 SDK to see whether we missed something
- [x] introduce schema for sync payload
- [ ] Get rid of hard-coded S2 token (use env var via Effect config)
- [x] Migrate S2 code snippets to `<Code lang="ts" meta="twoslash" code={CODE.someCode} title="some/file/path.ts" />`
- [x] Add example app (similar to Electric)
- [ ] add generic test for large batches (where S2 backend needs to paginate otherwise it would result in an error)
- [ ] Simplify API proxy implementation in S2 sync provider test setup (lots of complexity)
