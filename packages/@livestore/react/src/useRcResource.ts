import * as React from 'react'

/**
 * Creates a reference-counted resource object that is "stable" across React lifecycles.
 *
 * The hook is primarily intended for creating stateful objects or entities where:
 * 1) reference identity is crucial (e.g. stateful objects, references, ...)
 *    and needed to persist across multiple component instances
 * 2) the `create`/`dispose` functions might be effectful and can be called exactly once per key
 *
 * **Goals:**
 * - Guarantee stable reference identity for stateful entities that are created via the `create` function.
 * - Strong guarantees about the `create`/`dispose` calls (i.e. exactly one `create`/`dispose` call per key)
 * - Ensure that such state is retained across component re-mounts, even in development environments like
 *   React Strict Mode or during Fast Refresh.
 * - Automatically handle resource disposal by decrementing a reference count and disposing of the resource
 *   when no components are using it.
 *
 * **Behavior:**
 * - On the first render with a specific key, the `create` function is invoked to create the stateful entity,
 *   and the resource is stored in a cache with a reference count set to 1.
 * - If another component renders with the same key, the cached entity is reused and its reference count is incremented.
 * - When a component renders with a new key, the previous key's reference count is decremented and, if it reaches zero,
 *   the `dispose` function is called for that resource.
 * - Upon component unmount, the reference count is decremented, leading to disposal (via the `dispose` function)
 *   if the reference count drops to zero. An unmount is either detected via React's `useEffect` callback or
 *   in the useMemo hook when the key changes.
 * 
 * Why this is needed in LiveStore:
 * Let's first take a look at the "trivial implementation":
 * 
 * ```ts
 * const useSimpleResource = <T>(create: () => T, dispose: (resource: T) => void) => {
 *     const val = React.useMemo(() => create(), [create])
 *
 *     React.useEffect(() => {
 *       return () => {
 *         dispose(val)
 *       }
 *     }, [dispose, val])

 *     return val
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * LiveStore uses this hook to create LiveQuery instances which are stateful and must not be leaked.
 * The simple implementation above would leak the LiveQuery instance if the component is unmounted or props change.
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * ```tsx
 * // Create a stateful object instance for a unique key and share it between components.
 * const statefulObject = useRcResource(
 *   'stable-object-key',
 *   () => createObjectInstance(),
 *   (object) => object.dispose()
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * **Caveats:**
 * - The `create` function is intentionally omitted from the dependency array in `useMemo` to prevent
 *   unintended re-creations of the stateful entity. Avoid closing over changing values within `create`
 *   or include them in the `key`.
 * - Ensure that the `dispose` function is stable or properly memoized as its reference is used in a `useEffect`.
 * - Although the caching mechanism prevents duplicate instance creation for the same key, the strategy
 *   can interact in unexpected ways with React’s development patterns. Please report any issues if encountered.
 *
 * @template T The type of the stateful entity managed by the hook.
 * @param key A unique identifier for the stateful entity. A change in this key triggers a disposal of the previous resource.
 * @param create Function to create the stateful entity when it does not exist in the cache.
 * @param dispose Function to dispose of the stateful entity when it’s no longer needed. Needs to be stable.
 * @param _options Optional. Additional options such as a debug print callback for logging purposes.
 * @returns The stateful entity corresponding to the provided key.
