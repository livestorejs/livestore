# Sync Processors — Requirements

Role: `02-processors/` owns the two drivers of the merge core: the
`LeaderSyncProcessor` (leader⇄backend plus applying session pushes) and the
`ClientSessionSyncProcessor` (session⇄leader). Queueing, batching, retry,
precedence, and cursor semantics live here; *where* the processors run is
`../../04-runtime/`'s concern (LS.SYS.SYNC.SS-R04).

## Context

Builds on [../requirements.md](../requirements.md) and
[../01-syncstate/requirements.md](../01-syncstate/requirements.md). Code:
`packages/@livestore/common/src/leader-thread/LeaderSyncProcessor.ts`,
`packages/@livestore/common/src/sync/ClientSessionSyncProcessor.ts`.

Processor-specific requirements are pending a requirements-alignment pass;
until then the parent and syncstate requirements bind this node, and
[spec.md](./spec.md) captures current behavior.
