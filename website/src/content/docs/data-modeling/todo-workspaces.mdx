import { Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Requirements

- There are multiple independent todo workspaces
- Each workspace is initially created by a single user
- Users can join the workspace by knowing the workspace id and get read and write access
- For simplicity, the user identity is chosen when the app initially starts (i.e. a username) but in a real app this would be handled by a proper auth setup

## Data model

- We are splitting up our data model into two kinds of stores (with respective eventlogs and SQLite databases): The `workspace` store and the `user` store.

### `workspace` store (one per workspace)

For the `workspace` store we have the following events:

- `workspaceCreated`
- `todoAdded`
- `todoCompleted`
- `todoDeleted`
- `userJoined`

And the following state model:

- `workspace` table (with a single row for the workspace itself)
- `todo` table (with one row per todo item)
- `member` table (with one row per user who has joined the workspace)

### `user` store (one per user)

For the `user` store we have the following events:

- `workspaceCreated`
- `workspaceJoined`

And the following state model:

- `user` table (with a single row for the user itself)

Note that the `workspaceCreated` event is used both in the `workspace` and the `user` store. This is because each eventlog should be "self-sufficient" and not rely on other eventlogs to be present to fulfill its purpose.

## Schema

  const workspaceJoined = Events.synced({
    name: 'v1.ListJoined',
    schema: Schema.Struct({ workspaceId: Schema.String }),

  // Table to store basic user info
  // Contains only one row as this store is per-user.
  const userTable = State.SQLite.table({

    columns: {
      // Assuming username is unique and used as the identifier
      username: State.SQLite.text({ primaryKey: true }),

## Further notes

To make this app more production-ready, we might want to do the following:
- Use a proper auth setup to enforce a trusted user identity
- Introduce a proper user invite process
- Introduce access levels (e.g. read-only, read-write)
- Introduce end-to-end encryption
- If each todo item has a lot of data (e.g. think of a GitHub/Linear issue with lots of details), it might make sense to split up each todo item into its own store.
