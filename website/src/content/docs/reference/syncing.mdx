## Prior notes

### Design decisions / trade-offs

- LiveStore is based on the idea of event-sourcing
- It's similar to how Git works.
- Each client needs to first pull the latest events from the server before it can push its own mutation events.
- To sync across devices, there is assumed to be a central "server" that acts as the global authority.
  - It determines the total order of events (causality)
- Each client initialy chooses a random `clientId` as its globally unique ID
  - LiveStore uses a 6-char nanoid
	- In the unlikely event of a collision which is detected by the server the first time a client tries to push, the client chooses a new random `clientId`, patches the local events with the new `clientId`, and tries again.

### Requirements for sync server

- Needs to provide an efficient way to query an ordered list of mutation events given a starting event ID (often referred to as cursor).
- Ideally provides a "reactivity" mechanism to notify clients when new mutation events are available (e.g. via WebSocket, HTTP long-polling, etc).
  - Alternatively, the client can periodically query for new events which is less efficient.
