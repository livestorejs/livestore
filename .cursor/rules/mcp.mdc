## GitHub MCP

Use the `livestorejs/livestore` repo (unless asked differently) for GitHub repo management (e.g. issues, PRs...)
Don't create new issue labels unless asked.
Before creating new issues, search existing issues for potential duplicates/overlaps and clarify if needed.
When creating an issue, print a clickable link.
